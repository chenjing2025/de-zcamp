# Module 4 Homework
Goal: Transforming the data loaded in DWH into Analytical Views developing a [dbt project](taxi_rides_ny/README.md).

### Prerequisites
By this stage of the course you should have already: 

- A running warehouse (BigQuery or postgres) 
- A set of running pipelines ingesting the project dataset (week 3 completed)
- The following datasets ingested from the course [Datasets list](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/):
